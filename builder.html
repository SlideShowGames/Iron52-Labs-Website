        <h3>What happened?</h3>
        <p>
            On July 11, 2023, we at Mercury Workshop had 
            received a notice from Google, informing us 
            to take down both the downloads for the SH1MMER 
            bins and the website builder.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not wanting to deal with the legality of it all,
            we had no choice but to obligate with what they 
            requested from us, and the builder & bins have 
            been taken offline.
        </p>
        <p>
            This doesn't mark the end of things, but it does
            mean that we can no longer provide a place for users
            to download SH1MMER bins nor' build a injected shim.
        </p>
